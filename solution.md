1. Differentiate the following functions.

(a) $y=\sin ^{2} x$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d\left(\sin ^2 x\right)}{d x} & =\frac{d \sin x}{d x} \cdot 2 \cdot \sin x \\
& =2 \cdot \sin x \cdot \cos x \\
& =2 \sin (2 x)
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& y=\sin x \Rightarrow \frac{d y}{d x}=\cos x \\
& y=x^2 \Rightarrow \frac{d\left(x^2\right)}{d x}=2 x
\end{aligned}

(b) $y=x^{2} \cos x$

(c) $y=\frac{x}{\tan 2 x}$

(d) $y=a^{2 x^{2}}$ where $a$ is a positive constant greater than 1 .

2. (a) Show from first principles that for the curve $y=\sin x$, where $x$ is in radians,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=\cos x .
$$

You may use the formula for $\sin (A \pm B)$ without proof and assume that as $h \rightarrow 0$,
$$
\frac{\cos h-1}{h} \rightarrow 0 \text { and } \frac{\sin h}{h} \rightarrow 1 .
$$
(b) Identify where in the proof this assumption that $x$ is in radians is needed.

3. (a) Find an expression in terms of $x$ and $y$ for the gradient of the curve
$$
x^{2}+k x y+4 y^{2}=48
$$

(b) The diagram shows the curve where $k=2$.

Find the values of $y$ for which the tangent to the curve is vertical.
(c) Explain what happens to the gradient when $k=4$.

4. In this question you must show detailed reasoning

Show that the curve $y=x-\ln x$ has one turning point only, and give the coordinates of this point.

5. In this question you must show detailed reasoning

A curve has $y=\mathrm{e}^{2 x} \cos x$.
(a) Show that the turning points of the curve occur at the points for which 

$\tan x=2$.

(b) Find the equation of the normal to the curve at the point for which $x=0$.
