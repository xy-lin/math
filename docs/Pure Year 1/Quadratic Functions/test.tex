(a) Find the value of $k$.
(b) Solve the equation $2 x^{2}+5 x+k=0$.
4. In this question you must show detailed reasoning.

5. Solve these equations, giving your answers in exact form.
(a) $x^{\frac{2}{3}}+x^{\frac{1}{3}}-6=0$
(b) $x^{4}+3 x^{2}-10=0$
6. (a) Express $2 x^{2}+p x+q$ in the form $a(x+b)^{2}+c$.

8. Amy throws a ball so that when it is at its highest point, it passes through the centre of a hoop. The path of the ball is modelled by the equation $y=h+k x-\frac{1}{2} x^{2}$, where $y$ is the height of the ball in metres above the ground and $x$ is the horizontal distance in metres from the point at which the ball was thrown. The centre of the hoop is at the point where $x=2$ and $y=5$.
(a) Find the values of $h$ and $k$.
(b) Find the value of $x$ at which the ball hits the ground.
