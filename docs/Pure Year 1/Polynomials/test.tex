Find the values of $a, b, c$ and $d$.
3. In this question you must show detailed reasoning.
(a) Show that $(x-3)$ is a factor of $6 x^{3}-17 x^{2}-5 x+6$.
(b) Solve the equation $6 x^{3}-17 x^{2}-5 x+6=0$.
4. In this question you must show detailed reasoning.

Show algebraically that $x=2$ is the only real root of the equation $x^{3}-x-6=0$.
5. In this question you must show detailed reasoning.
(a) Show that $x=-1$ is a root of the equation $x^{3}-5 x^{2}+2 x+8=0$.
