1. Write $\log x-3 \log 2 y+4 \log z$ as a single logarithm.
2. Express $\log \frac{\sqrt{p}}{q r^{2}}$ in terms of $\log p, \log q$ and $\log r$.
3. Solve the following equations;
(a) $3^{2 x}=5$
(b) $2 \mathrm{e}^{x}=3 \mathrm{e}^{-x}+5$
\((c)\) $\quad \ln (2 x+1)=\ln x+2$
giving your answers in exact form.
4. The temperature $T^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ of the water in a kettle $t$ minutes after boiling is modelled by the equation $T=20+80 \mathrm{e}^{-0.5 t}$.
(a) What is the initial temperature of the water?
(b) Find the temperature of the water after 5 minutes.
\((c)\) Find the time at which the temperature of the water is $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
(d) Find the initial rate of cooling, and the rate of cooling after 2 minutes.
(e) What will the long-term temperature of the water be?
5. In an experiment, the number of bacteria, $N$, in a culture was estimated at time $t$ days after the experiment started.
The results were as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline$t$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline$N$ & 120 & 170 & 250 & 400 & 620 & 910 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

It is believed that the relationship between $N$ and $t$ can be expressed in the form
$$
N=a b^{t}
$$
where $a$ and $b$ are constants.
(a) Use logarithms to draw a linear graph.
(b) Use your graph to estimate the values of $a$ and $b$.
\((c)\) Estimate the number of bacteria present after 20 days. State, with a reason, whether your estimate is likely to be a good one.
6. The equation $\log _{3}(2 x+p)=2 \log _{3}(2 x)-1$ has one real root. What is the value of $p$ ?

7. It is believed that two quantities, $x$ and $y$, are connected by a relationship of the form $y=k x^{n}$, where $k$ and $n$ are constants.
In an experiment, the following data were produced.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline$x$ & 5 & 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 & 35 \\
\hline$y$ & 9 & 24 & 48 & 69 & 102 & 131 & 166 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To test the relationship Allegra has plotted the points on the graph below and drawn on a line of best fit:

(a) Use Allegra's graph to estimate the values of $k$ and $n$.
(b) Use Allegra's model to estimate the value of $y$ when $x=60$.

Comment upon the reliability of this estimate.
