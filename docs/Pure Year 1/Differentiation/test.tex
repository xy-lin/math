1. Given that $y=\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}}$, write down $\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}$.
2. A curve has equation $y=x^{3}+4 x^{2}-3 x+1$.
(a) Sketch the gradient function for the curve.
(b) State the range of values of $x$ for which $x^{3}+4 x^{2}-3 x+1$ is decreasing.
3. Show that the only stationary point on the curve $y=2 x^{2}-\sqrt{x}$ is a minimum point.
4. A curve has equation $y=2 x^{3}-3 x^{2}-8 x+9$.

Find the equations of the two tangents to the curve which have gradient 4 .
5. (a) Find the equation of the normal to the graph $y=x-\frac{2}{x^{2}}$ at the point where $x=1$.[3]
(b) Show that the normal does not meet the curve again.
6. Sabah is using a spreadsheet to investigate the gradient of the curve $y=x^{4}$. She uses the spreadsheet to calculate the gradient of the chord from the point where $x=2$ to the point where $x=2+h$ for different values of $h$. Part of her spreadsheet is shown below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & A & B & C & D & E & F \\
\hline 1 & x & f(x) & h & x+h & f(x+h) & Gradient \\
\hline 2 & 2 & 16 & 1 & 3 & 81 & 65 \\
\hline 3 & 2 & 16 & 0.1 & 2.1 & & 34.481 \\
\hline 4 & 2 & 16 & 0.01 & 2.01 & 16.32240801 & \\
\hline 5 & 2 & 16 & 0.001 & & 16.03202401 & 32.024008 \\
\hline 6 & 2 & 16 & 0.0001 & 2.0001 & 16.00320024 & 32.00240008 \\

(a) Fill in the missing values in cells D5, E3 and F4.
(b) Use differentiation from first principles to show that the gradient of the curve $y=x^{4}$ at the point where $x=2$ is 32 .
7. In this question you must show detailed reasoning.

Find the stationary points of the graph $y=\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{x^{2}}-\frac{1}{x^{3}}$.
Determine the nature of each.
8. Two real numbers $x$ and $y$ are such that $k x+y=100$, where $k$ is a positive constant. Find, in terms of $k$, the maximum value of the product of the two numbers.
9. A cuboid has a square base of length $x \mathrm{~cm}$ and height $y \mathrm{~cm}$. The surface area of the cuboid is $24 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
(a) Show that $V=6 x-0.5 x^{3}$.
(b) Show that the maximum volume of the cuboid occurs when $x=2$, and find this maximum volume.
