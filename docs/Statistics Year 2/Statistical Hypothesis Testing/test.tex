(b) Describe in words the correlation in the following three diagrams, and suggest a value for $r$ in each case:

2. A survey of weather in a tropical region is undertaken and the data analysed. The product moment correlation coefficient between the daily mean temperature and the daily rainfall is calculated as 0.267 with a $p$-value of 0.035 . Stating your hypotheses clearly, use a $2.5 \%$ significance level to test whether or not there is evidence of a positive correlation between the daily mean temperature and the daily rainfall in the region.
3. A sports scientist wishes to test whether those who are good at sprinting are also good at long jump. For a sample of 30 athletes, she records the time, $t$, taken for them to run 100 m , and the distance, $d$, jumped at long jump. She calculates the correlation coefficient, $r$, for $d$ against $t$, and finds that $r=-0.35$.
(a) Write down the null and alternative hypotheses for her test. Explain why the alternative hypothesis takes the form that it does.
(b) The critical value for a one-tailed test with $n=30$ at $5 \%$ significance level is 0.3061 . Explain whether or not there is evidence for correlation in the population.

4. The manufacturer claims that packets of pasta have a mass of 500 g . The masses are normally distributed and the standard deviation is known to be 5 g . An inspector wants to find out if the packets are underweight. She weighs 16 packets of cereal and finds that they have a total mass of 7955 g . Carry out a hypothesis test at the $2 \%$ level.
5. A driver wishes to improve his reaction time, which is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0.34 seconds and standard deviation 0.06 seconds. The driver undertakes a training course. Afterwards, a random sample of 8 reaction times is taken and the times are as follows (in seconds).
$$
\begin{array}{llllllll}
0.323 & 0.266 & 0.319 & 0.338 & 0.304 & 0.296 & 0.284 & 0.354
\end{array}
$$

Assuming that the underlying standard deviation has not changed, test at the $1 \%$ level whether the driver's mean reaction time has decreased after the training course.
6. The heights of three year old children are thought to be normally distributed, with a mean of 90 cm and a standard deviation of 5 cm . A scientist wishes to determine whether the mean height has changed, using a sample of 15 children.
(a) Stating your hypotheses clearly, find the critical region for a two-tailed test at the $10 \%$ significance level.
(b) A random sample of 15 children is taken and the following heights are measured:

\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
88 & 94 & 90 & 92 & 91 \\
89 & 93 & 87 & 95 & 90 \\
96 & 93 & 89 & 91 & 93
\end{tabular}

Using your answer to (a), decide what conclusion the scientist should draw.
(c) Another scientist repeats the experiment with a larger sample, and tests for a change in mean height at both the $10 \%$ level and the $5 \%$ level. She finds that at the $10 \%$ level she should reject the null hypothesis but at the $5 \%$ level she should not reject the null hypothesis. Explain, with reference to the two significance levels, how it is possible for the same data to give two different conclusions.
