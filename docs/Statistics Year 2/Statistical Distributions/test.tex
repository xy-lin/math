1. $X \sim N(5,16)$

(b) Write down the value of $\mathrm{P}(X \neq 2)$.
(c) Find $\mathrm{P}(6<X<8)$.
2. The weights of avocados are normally distributed normally with mean 204 g and standard deviation 25 g . The avocados are classified as small, medium or large. Large avocados weigh more than 220 g , small avocados weigh less than 180 g . All other avocados are classified as medium. Calculate, to one decimal place, the percentage of avocados in each grade.
3. Components produced by a factory machine have masses that are normally distributed.
(a) The machine is initially set so that the mean mass is 0.249 kg and standard deviation 0.005 kg . A component is required to have a mass within the limits 0.247 kg and 0.252 kg . Calculate to the nearest whole number the percentage of components produced that are outside the required limits.
(b) The machine is now set so that the mean mass is $\mu \mathrm{kg}$, the standard deviation still being 0.005 kg . Given that $10 \%$ of the components now have masses greater than 0.252 kg , find $\mu$ to 3 decimal places.
4. A survey of 200 workers to look at their commuting time, $X$ minutes, had the following results:
$$
\sum x=10840, \sum x^{2}=597560
$$
(a) Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of $X$
(b) It is initially assumed that $X$ can be modelled as a normal distribution.
(i) Calculate, to 3 significant figures, the probability that a commuter chosen at random has a commuting time of less than 45 minutes.
(ii) The 200 commuters are put into groups of 20. Calculate, to 2 significant figures, the probability that in a randomly selected group, fewer than 5 of them will have a commuting time of less than 45 minutes.
(c) When an additional question is asked in the survey it is found that 10 of the 200 workers have a commuting time of more than an hour and a half. Determine with a reason whether the normal distribution is suitable to model this data.
5. (a) The volume, $L$ litres, of a tub of one brand of paint may be assumed to be normally distributed. $40 \%$ of the tubs contain less than 10.2 litres of paint and $98 \%$ of tubs contain more than 10 litres of emulsion paint. Find the mean and the standard deviation to 2 decimal places.
(b) The volume, $P$ litres, of a tub of another brand of paint is normally distributed with a mean of 10.15 and a standard deviation of 0.1 . A case contains 12 tubs of paint. Find, to 2 decimal places, the probability that fewer than 3 tubs contain less than 10 litres of paint.
