1. Using the chain rule, differentiate $\left(x^{2}-1\right)^{6}$.
2. Show that the gradient of $y=\left(x^{2}-1\right)(x-2)^{3}$ is given by
$$
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} x}=(x-2)^{2}\left(5 x^{2}-4 x-3\right) . \tag{4}
\end{equation*}
$$
3. Show that the gradient of the curve $y=\frac{x-1}{x^{2}-3}$ at the point where $x=2$ is -3 .
4. A potter is making an open topped vessel shaped as a right circular cylinder of radius $r$ and height $2 r$.
(a) Show that the volume $V$ of the vessel is given by $V=2 \pi r^{3}$
(b) Find the rate at which the volume is increasing when the radius is 2 cm and increasing at a rate of $0.25 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$.
(c) Given that the volume is increasing at a rate of $5 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{s}$ when the radius is 5 cm , find the rate at which the surface area is increasing at this point.
5. In this question you must show detailed reasoning.

A curve has equation $y=3 x^{4}-8 x^{3}+6 x^{2}+1$.
(a) Find the coordinates of the stationary points and determine their nature.
(b) Sketch the curve.
(c) Find the values for $x$ for which the curve is concave upwards.
6. In this question you must show detailed reasoning.

A log of wood is modelled as a cylinder with radius 10 cm and height 25 cm . It is to be made into a cuboid with dimensions $2 x \mathrm{~cm}$ by $2 y \mathrm{~cm}$ by 25 cm by trimming the cylinder. The cross-section is shown in the diagram.
