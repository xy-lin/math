1. Prove that $x^{2}+1>2 x y-y^{2}$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.
2. By finding counter-examples, disprove the following statements:
(a) If $a-b$ is a rational number and $a \neq b$, then $a$ and $b$ are both rational numbers.
(b) If $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}$then $n^{3}-n+7$ is a prime number.
3. Prove by exhaustion that if $n \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}, n \leq 6$ then $n^{2}+n+41$ is a prime number.
4. Prove by contradiction that the product of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
5. Prove that when the square of an odd number is divided by 8 , the remainder is 1 .
6. Prove that the final digit of a square number cannot be 3 .
7. Prove by contradiction that $\log _{3} 2$ is irrational.
8. (a) Prove by contradiction that $\sqrt{5}$ is irrational.
(b) Explain where the proof above fails if you try to use it to prove that $\sqrt{4}$ is irrational.
