1. Solve the equation $\sin \left(x+30^{\circ}\right)=\cos x$ for $0^{\circ} \leq x \leq 360^{\circ}$.

2. In this question you must show detailed reasoning

The curves $y=\cos x$ and $y=\sin \left(\frac{x}{2}\right), 0 \leq x \leq \pi$, meet at the point P , as shown below.

Find the coordinates of the point P .
3. Prove that $\frac{\sin 2 x-\cos 2 x+1}{\sin 2 x+\cos 2 x+1} \equiv \tan x$.
4. (a) Describe a sequence of three transformations that maps the graph of $y=\sin x$ on to the graph of $y=4 \cos 2 x+3 \sin 2 x$, where $x$ is measured in radians, justifying your answer fully.
(b) Find the range of the function $\mathrm{f}(x)=\frac{1}{4 \cos 2 x+3 \sin 2 x}$
5. (a) Prove that $4\left(\sin ^{4} x+\cos ^{4} x\right) \equiv \cos 4 x+3$
(b) Solve the equation $\sin ^{4} x+\cos ^{4} x=0.5$ for $0 \leq x \leq 2 \pi$.
6. When a bicycle is travelling at a constant speed, the height above the ground of the valve on the tyre measured in metres at time $t$ seconds, can be modelled by the function:
$\mathrm{h}(t)=0.34+0.252 \cos 14.5 t-0.144 \sin 14.5 t$
where angles are measured in radians.
Showing your working carefully, find:
(a) The maximum height of the valve above the ground, in metres to 2 significant figures, and the first time that this occurs, in seconds to 2 significant figures.
(b) The distance of the valve from the outer circumference of the tyre, in metres to 1 significant figure.
\((c)\) The time taken for the tyre to complete one full revolution, in seconds to 2 significant figures.
(d) The speed of the bicycle, in metres per second to 2 significant figures.
