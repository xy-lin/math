1. A racing car accelerates from rest along the track. Its speed, $v \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, is modelled for the first four seconds of its motion by
$$
v=t^{3}-9 t^{2}+24 t, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 4 .
$$
(a) Find an expression for the distance travelled by the car in the first $t$ seconds.
(b) Calculate the distance travelled from $t=2$ to $t=4$.
\((c)\) Show that the acceleration, $a \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$, of the car at time $t$ is given by $a=k(t-2)(t-4)$, where $k$ is a constant to be determined.
2. A particle moves on the $x$-axis. Its displacement, $x \mathrm{~m}$, from the origin O is given by $x=3 t^{2}-3 t+2$, where $t$ is the time in seconds.

How far is the particle from O when it is instantaneously at rest?
3. At $t=0$ a particle travels through point P with a velocity of $-9 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$. The acceleration of the particle is given by $a=0.6 t-3.9$.
(a) Find the times when the velocity, $v$, is $-18 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$.
(b) Find the distance covered by the particle when $v \leq-18 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$.
4. An insect moves in a straight line. The time, $t$, is in seconds and distance travelled is in metres.

The velocity, $v \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, of the insect is given by
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
v=t^{2}-4 t, & 0 \leq t \leq 6, \\
v=c, & 6 \leq t \leq 10, \\
v=a t+b, & 10 \leq t \leq 15 .
\end{array}
$$

You are also given that $v=4$ when $t=12$.
(a) Show that $c=12$.
(b) Calculate the values of $a$ and $b$ and briefly describe the motion of the insect in the interval $10 \leq t \leq 15$.
\((c)\) Sketch the $v$ - $t$ curve for the motion of the insect in the interval $0 \leq t \leq 6$.
(d) Calculate the distance travelled by the insect in the interval $0 \leq t \leq 10$.

5. The motion of a particle is represented on the velocity time graph shown below. The motion is given by the equations:
$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}
v & =2 t^{2}-3 t-\frac{1}{3} t^{3}, & 0 \leq t \leq 4 \\
v & =1.5 t+c, & t & \geq 4
\end{array}
$$

The particle returns to its starting position at time $T$.
Find the velocity of the particle at time $T$.
