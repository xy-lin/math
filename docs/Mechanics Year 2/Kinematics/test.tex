1. In this question, $\mathbf{i}$ and $\mathbf{j}$ are the standard unit vectors in the $\mathrm{O} x$ and $\mathrm{O} y$ directions. An object has initial position $(2 \mathbf{i}-\mathbf{j}) \mathrm{m}$ and velocity $(-\mathbf{i}+4 \mathbf{j}) \mathrm{ms}^{-1}$. It has a constant acceleration of $(2 \mathbf{i}+5 \mathbf{j}) \mathrm{ms}^{-2}$.
Calculate the object's velocity and position after four seconds.

(b) Is the particle ever at rest?
3. A particle has acceleration $\mathbf{a}=\binom{2 t}{3} \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ at time $t$. Initially the particle has velocity $\binom{1}{-2} \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ and is at the point $(2,0)$. Find the position vector of the particle at time $t$.
4. A particle has velocity $\mathbf{v}=(2 t+1) \mathbf{i}-\left(3 t^{2}-1\right) \mathbf{j} \mathrm{ms}^{-1}$ and is initially at the origin. Find its distance from the origin after 3 seconds.
5. In this question, the vectors i and j and unit vectors east and north respectively.
(a) A particle moves in two dimensions with constant acceleration. Initially it has position vector $3 \mathbf{i}+2 \mathbf{j} \mathrm{~m}$ relative to a fixed origin and has initial velocity $\mathbf{i}+\mathbf{j} \mathrm{ms}^{-1}$. After 4 seconds it has position vector $7 \mathbf{i}-4 \mathbf{j} \mathrm{~m}$.
What is its velocity at that time?
(b) The particle then continues at constant speed.

Calculate how long the particle has been travelling at constant speed when it is southeast of the origin.
6. In this question, $\mathbf{i}$ and $\mathbf{j}$ are unit vectors which are horizontal and vertically upwards. The units for postion are metres.
A particle has mass 4 kg .
(a) Write down the weight of the particle in vector form.

The particle is acted on by two forces $(3 \mathbf{i}+2 \mathbf{j}) \mathrm{N}$ and $(-2 \mathbf{i}+8 \mathbf{j}) \mathrm{N}$.
(b) Find the acceleration of the particle.

The particle is initially at rest at a point with position vector $(4 \mathbf{i}+7 \mathbf{j}) \mathrm{m}$.
\((c)\) Find the position of the particle after 3s.
(d) Find the time at which the particle is at the same height as the origin.
