1. A particle is projected from a point on horizontal ground with a velocity of $25 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ at an angle of $35^{\circ}$ to the ground.
(a) Calculate the maximum height reached by the particle.

+++ <span style="color:blue">Hint</span>

<div style="font-size: 22px;">

Work out the vertical component of the initial velocity using trigonometry. Then use the kinematic equations to find the maximum height.
$$ v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s $$
s is maximum height, u is initial vertical velocity, v is final vertical velocity (0 at maximum height), and a is acceleration due to gravity (-9.8 m/sÂ²).

</div>

+++

+++ <span style="color:green">Solutions</span>

<div style="font-size: 22px">

to calculate the maximum height, we first need to find the vertical component of the initial velocity. The vertical component $u_y$ can be calculated using the formula:
$$ u_y = u \sin \theta $$
where:
$u = 25 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ (initial velocity)
$\theta = 35^{\circ}$ (angle of projection)
Calculating $u_y$:
$$ u_y = 25 \sin 35^{\circ} \approx 25 \times 0.574 = 14.35 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} $$
Next, we can use the following kinematic equation to find the maximum height $H$:
$$ v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s $$
where:
$v = 0 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ (final velocity at maximum height)
$u = 14.35 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ (initial vertical velocity)
$a = -9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ (acceleration due to gravity, negative because it is acting downwards)
$s = H$ (maximum height)
Rearranging the equation to solve for $H$:
$$ 0 = (14.35)^2 + 2(-9.8)H $$
$$ 0 = 205.92 - 19.6H $$
$$ 19.6H = 205.92 $$
$$ H = \frac{205.92}{19.6} \approx 10.5 \mathrm{~m} $$
Therefore, the maximum height reached by the particle is approximately $10.5 \mathrm{~m}$.

$$ D = u_x \times T $$
Calculating $D$:
$$ D = 20.48 \times 2.93 \approx 60.0 \mathrm{~m} $$

$u = 0 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$ (initial vertical velocity, since the pebble is thrown horizontally)

The horizontal position $x$ after time $t$ is given by:

$$ y = \frac{4x}{3} - \frac{5x^2}{81} $$

This gives us two solutions:

The vertical component of the velocity $u_y$ at time $t$ can be found using the equation:

Calculating $v$:

$$ v \approx \sqrt{528.48 + 22.94} \approx \sqrt{551.42} \approx 23.48 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1} $$

$$ \tan \phi = \frac{4.79}{22.98} \approx 0.208 $$
$$ \phi \approx \tan^{-1}(0.208) \approx 11.8^{\circ} $$
Since the vertical component of the velocity $u_y$ is positive, the stone is still rising as it passes over the wall.
Therefore, the speed of the stone as it passes over the wall is approximately $23.48 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$, and the angle between the direction of motion of the stone and the horizontal is approximately $11.8^{\circ}$, with the stone rising.

where: 
a = -g (acceleration due to gravity),
u = U sin Î± (initial vertical velocity),
s = H (maximum height above the point of projection),
v = 0 (final vertical velocity at maximum height).

And remember that the height above the point of projection is 2.8 m - 2.5 m = 0.3 m. So \(H = 0.3 m\).

So:

$$ 0 = (U \sin \alpha)^2 - 2gH $$

$$ H = \frac{u_y^2}{2g} $$
where:
\( u_y = U \sin \alpha \) is the vertical component of the initial velocity,
\( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2} \)).
Given that the ball reaches a maximum height of 2.8 m above the ground and is projected from a height of 2.5 m, the height above the point of projection is:
$$ H = 2.8 \mathrm{~m} - 2.5 \mathrm{~m} = 0.3 \mathrm{~m} $$
Substituting \( H \) and \( u_y \) into the kinematic equation:
$$ 0.3 = \frac{(U \sin \alpha)^2}{2g} $$
Rearranging the equation to solve for \( U^2 \):
$$ (U \sin \alpha)^2 = 0.3 \times 2g $$
$$ U^2 \sin^2 \alpha = 0.6g $$
Finally, dividing both sides by \( \sin^2 \alpha \):

$$ y = U \sin \alpha \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$
Substituting \( x = 12 \) m into the first equation to find \( t \):
$$ t = \frac{12}{U \cos \alpha} $$

Substituting \( U^2 = \frac{3g}{5 \sin^2 \alpha} \) into the equation:
$$ -1.6 = 12 \tan \alpha - \frac{1}{2} g \cdot \frac{144}{\frac{3g}{5 \sin^2 \alpha} \cos^2 \alpha} $$
Simplifying further:
$$ -1.6 = 12 \tan \alpha - \frac{1}{2} g \cdot \frac{144 \cdot 5 \sin^2 \alpha}{3g \cos^2 \alpha} $$
$$ -1.6 = 12 \tan \alpha - \frac{120 \sin^2 \alpha}{\cos^2 \alpha} $$
Rearranging the equation:
$$ 120 \tan^2 \alpha - 12 \tan \alpha - \frac{8}{5} = 0 $$

(d) To be a legal serve the ball must land less than 18.4 m from the server. Determine whether the serve is legal.

+++ <span style="color:blue">Hint</span>

<div style="font-size: 22px;">

We first need to find the time of flight \( t \) using the vertical motion equation:
$$ y = U \sin \alpha \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$

When ball lands, \( y = -2.5 \) m (the ball lands 2.5 m below the point of projection).

Then, we can calculate the horizontal distance \( x \) using the horizontal motion equation:
$$ x = U \cos \alpha \cdot t $$

To determine whether the serve is legal, we need to calculate the horizontal distance the ball travels before landing.
Using the horizontal motion equation:
$$ x = U \cos \alpha \cdot t $$
We first need to find the time of flight \( t \) using the vertical motion equation:
$$ y = U \sin \alpha \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$
Setting \( y = -2.5 \) m (the ball lands 2.5 m below the point of projection):
$$ -2.5 = 13.95 \sin 10.0^{\circ} \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 9.8 \cdot t^2 $$
Calculating \( 13.95 \sin 10.0^{\circ} \approx 2.42 \):
$$ -2.5 = 2.42t - 4.9t^2 $$
Rearranging the equation:
$$ 4.9t^2 - 2.42t - 2.5 = 0 $$
Using the quadratic formula to solve for \( t \):
$$ t = \frac{2.42 \pm \sqrt{(-2.42)^2 - 4 \cdot 4.9 \cdot (-2.5)}}{2 \cdot 4.9} $$
Calculating the discriminant:
$$ (-2.42)^2 - 4 \cdot 4.9 \cdot (-2.5) = 5.8564 + 49 = 54.8564 $$
Calculating \( t \):
$$ t = \frac{2.42 \pm \sqrt{54.8564}}{9.8} $$
Calculating \( \sqrt{54.8564} \approx 7.41 \):
$$ t = \frac{2.42 \pm 7.41}{9.8} $$
This gives us two possible solutions for \( t \):
1. \( t = \frac{9.83}{9.8} \approx 1.00 \mathrm{~s} \)
2. \( t = \frac{-4.99}{9.8} \) (not physically meaningful for this context)
Taking the positive solution:
$$ t \approx 1.00 \mathrm{~s} $$
Now, we can calculate the horizontal distance \( x \):
$$ x = 13.95 \cos 10.0^{\circ} \cdot 1.00 $$
Calculating \( 13.95 \cos 10.0^{\circ} \approx 13.75 \):
$$ x \approx 13.75 \mathrm{~m} $$
Since the ball lands approximately 13.75 m from the server, which is less than the legal limit of 18.4 m, the serve is legal.

(e) Explain why a particle model may not be good enough to predict the flight of a tennis ball.

+++ <span style="color:green">Solutions</span>

<div style="font-size: 22px">

A particle model may not be good enough to predict the flight of a tennis ball because it neglects factors such as air resistance, spin, and the ball's size and shape. Air resistance can significantly affect the trajectory of the ball, especially at high speeds. Additionally, the ball's size and shape can affect how it interacts with the air, leading to deviations from the idealized projectile motion predicted by a simple particle model.
